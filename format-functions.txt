# If no format functions list is given to format-plugin, it will use the list
# given below.  Each line has three or four columns separated by whitespace
# and their meaning is as follows:
# Column 1 -- the name of a format function to be checked.
# Column 2 -- identifies the type of format function: printf, scanf, NSString,
#             strftime, strfmon, kprintf or gettext.
#             If this column is gettext, the function is not a format function
#             but rather passes a format string onward by way of its return
#             value (as the format_arg attribute in GCC).  Such functions may
#             accept one or more format strings, and this is expressed by
#             listing the function once for each format string it accepts.
# Column 3 -- the argument that is the format string, where the first argument
#             is 1.
# Column 4 -- the argument that is the first variable argument, where the
#             first argument is 1.
#             If this column is 0 or not present, the function accepts a
#             va_list and the arguments are not checked.
#
# Empty lines are ignored.  Comments begin with # and proceed to the end of
# the line.
