# If no string functions list is given to string-plugin, it will use the list
# given below.  Each line has two or three columns separated by whitespace
# and their meaning is as follows:
# Column 1 -- the name of a string function to be checked.
# Column 2 -- the argument that is the unbounded string, where the first
#             argument is 1.
#             Functions may be listed more than once, so that more than one
#             argument can be checked.
# Column 3 -- a replacement function that accepts a size for its output string.
#             If this column is not present, no replacement is suggested in
#             the message.
#
# Empty lines are ignored.  Comments begin with # and proceed to the end of
# the line.
